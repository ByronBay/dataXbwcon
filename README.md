Data-X Masterclass
=======================

### Feb 14-15

This is the official Github repository for the Masterclass.

#### High level outline:
* **Day 1:** We will help you tackle the challenge of business creation and business transformation in the age of data. We‚Äôll discuss and teach how data and algorithms projects relate to a firm‚Äôs general business strategy, leadership, culture, and business objectives. We will teach you about data-driven business models so that you can monetize the power in your data.
* **Day 2:** We will also teach you how to practically use Data Science and AI tools that drive the development of smart emerging technologies. Optionally, for those interested, we will go through the most useful open-source tools in the Data Scientist's toolbox and get our hands dirty with state-of-the-art software and techniques to preprocess data, conduct analysis, make predictions, deploy applications and much more.
